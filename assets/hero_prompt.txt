A high-end sci-fi isometric illustration of a software architecture, showing 4 floating 3D platforms connected by glowing arrows.

System overview: This project appears to be a Python-based tool for automating Git repository actions, potentially related to artistic or creative contributions. It includes functionality for smart pushing and uses scripts for repository manipulation.

Components as floating platforms:
Platform 1: Label "Git Automation Core". Type: backend. Role: Core logic for automating Git operations and managing repository interactions.
Platform 2: Label "Repository Artist Script". Type: cli. Role: A command-line interface script responsible for artistic manipulation or modification of the repository.
Platform 3: Label "Smart Push Module". Type: backend. Role: A module that implements intelligent or conditional Git push functionality.
Platform 4: Label "Project Dependencies". Type: other. Role: Manages the external Python libraries required for the project's execution.

Data flows between platforms:
Arrow from "Repository Artist Script" to "Git Automation Core": "Interacts with core Git operations"
Arrow from "Smart Push Module" to "Git Automation Core": "Utilizes core Git operations for pushing"
Arrow from "Git Automation Core" to "Project Dependencies": "Relies on external libraries"

Visual style requirements:
- Professional futuristic dark UI background with deep blue/purple tones
- Isometric 3D perspective with floating glass/metallic platforms
- Neon blue and magenta accent lighting with subtle glow effects
- Clear, readable English labels on or near each platform
- Glowing directional arrows showing data/control flow between components
- Wide horizontal banner composition (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Clean and non-cartoonish, suitable as a GitHub README hero image
- No random abstract shapes, crystals, or unrelated elements
